Project Overview

Peacock is an innovative digital platform designed to revolutionize the traditional casting process in Egypt and the Arab world. By utilizing Artificial Intelligence, the project aims to solve the chronic issues of traditional casting offices, such as extreme overcrowding, health risks, and lack of transparency. The project presents a sophisticated "Digital Bridge" where actors can showcase their unique talents (symbolized by the Peacock's feathers) and production houses can discover the perfect fit for their artistic works in a professional, safe, and elegant environment.

Project Objectives

Digital Transformation: Moving the casting process from physical, crowded offices to a seamless AI-driven digital platform.

Safety & Professionalism: Eliminating health risks like fainting and suffocation by providing a remote, organized selection system.

Fair Opportunity: Preventing fraud and exploitation by providing a trusted, direct channel between talent and producers.

Efficiency: Saving time and effort for production houses through smart AI filtering based on specific project requirements.

Project Scope

Identity Design: Developing a premium visual identity including the Master Logo, Wordmark, and Iconography.

Brand Strategy: Defining the brand's unique positioning (The Peacock Metaphor) and competitive edge.

Visual Research: Conducting deep market audits and moodboarding to align with cinematic luxury.

Digital Mockups: Designing the user interface (UI) for the mobile app and web platform.

Brand Guidelines: Creating a comprehensive Brand Book that defines the usage rules and visual standards.

Final Deliverable: A complete Visual Identity System and Brand Strategy Book for the "Peacock" platform, including all digital and print assets.
