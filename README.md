✨ About the Brand

Why the name "Peacock"?
The peacock is nature's ultimate performer. During mating season, the male spreads his tail to showcase his health and uniqueness, and the female selects the most distinguished one. This perfectly mirrors the relationship between an Actor and a Production Company.

Our brand reflects Elegance, Distinction, and Professionalism, serving as a unique bridge in the Egyptian and Arab markets.

💡 The Core Idea

We aim to simplify the casting experience. We empower aspiring actors to secure their screen debuts through a platform designed for:

Simple 🟢

Professional 💼

Elegant ✨

Progressive 🚀

⚠️ The Problem We Solve

Traditional casting offices often face extreme crowding, especially before the Ramadan season. This leads to:

Health Risks: Fainting and suffocation due to poor ventilation in crowded offices.

Inefficiency: Manual submissions and huge time/effort loss for both actors and casting directors.

Lack of Tech Integration: Minimal use of AI or modern digital filtering to find the right talent quickly.

Peacock provides a modern, safe, and tech-driven alternative to ensure talent is discovered without the chaos.

🎯 Brand Message & Values

"Building healthy relationships between every actor and production company to provide continuous job opportunities in the field."

🔍 Competitor Analysis

We analyzed the market to ensure Peacock stands out. Key competitors include:

Cast Me Now: Uses a blue theme to evoke tranquility and trust, inspired by the filmmaking clapperboard.

Cast It Systems: Uses purple for creativity and luxury, with a logo inspired by a searchlight "C".

Backstage: Focuses on theatrical wings and negative space in its branding.

Peacock differentiates itself by focusing on the "Showcase" aspect and utilizing modern UI/UX to streamline the talent discovery journey.

🎭 Conceptual Customer Experience

We offer an experience distinguished by:

Digital First: No more physical crowding.

Smart Filtering: Helping production companies find the exact match.

Visual Excellence: A premium feel that respects the artist's journey.
