📝 Project Overview

🚀 Peacock is an innovative digital platform designed to revolutionize the traditional casting process in Egypt and the Arab world. By utilizing Artificial Intelligence 🤖, the project aims to solve the chronic issues of traditional casting offices, such as extreme overcrowding, health risks, and lack of transparency. The project presents a sophisticated "Digital Bridge" 🌉 where actors can showcase their unique talents (symbolized by the Peacock's feathers) and production houses can discover the perfect fit for their artistic works in a professional, safe, and elegant environment. 🎭

🎯 Project Objectives

🌐 Digital Transformation: Moving the casting process from physical, crowded offices to a seamless AI-driven digital platform.

🛡️ Safety & Professionalism: Eliminating health risks like fainting and suffocation by providing a remote, organized selection system.

⚖️ Fair Opportunity: Preventing fraud and exploitation by providing a trusted, direct channel between talent and producers.

⚡ Efficiency: Saving time and effort for production houses through smart AI filtering based on specific project requirements.
